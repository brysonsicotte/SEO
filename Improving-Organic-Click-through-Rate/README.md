# Improving Organic Click-through Rate

### Description

If you own a website, you want to drive as much traffic to your site as possible. 

The goal of this project to save SEO professionals time by automating the process of identifying webpages that stand to gain the most by improving metadata. These "high opportunity" webpages are defined here as, "pages with an above-average volume of impressions on Google and a below-average click-through rate." Once identified, the list can further be sorted by meta title length and meta decription length, allowing users to focus first on the shorter character counts.
