# Improving Organic Clickthrough Rate

### Description

The goal of this project to save SEO professionals time by automating the process of identifying webpages with the most opportunity for improvement. "Most opportunity" is defined here as, "pages with an above average volume of impressions on Google and a below-average click-through rate." Once identified, the list can further be sorted by meta title length and meta decription length, allowing users to focus first on pages with shorter character counts.
